# CALCULATOR APP

I’m Creating a Simple Calculator with GUI in Python using the ‘Tkinter’ Library. The ‘Tkinter’ library provides various widgets that allow us to Build a basic calculator.

## How Does the Code Work?

1. **Importing Libraries**: I use ‘tkinter’ for GUI elements and a messagebox for showing error messages.
2. **Perform Calculation Function**: This function retrieves input numbers, and the selected operation, and performs the calculation. It displays an error message if an issue exists, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
3. **Creating the GUI**:
   - Labels and Entry Widgets: For input numbers.
   - Option Menu: A dropdown menu to select the operation (+, -, *, /).
   - Button: A "Calculate" button triggers the calculation.
   - Label: To display the result of the calculation.
4. **Starting the Application**: root.mainloop() starts the application and keeps it running until the user closes it.

## Run the Program

To run this program
1.	Save the script to a .py file.
2.	Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3.	Run the script using a Python interpreter (python script_name.py).

This will launch a simple calculator GUI, allowing you to perform basic arithmetic operations.
